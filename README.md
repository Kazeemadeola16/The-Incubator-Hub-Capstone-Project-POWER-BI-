## Project Overview

As part of my capstone project at The Incubator Hub (Digital Skill Africa), I carried out an HR Salary Analysis using the Palmora Group Employee dataset. This project was designed to test my analytical thinking, technical skills, and storytelling ability using data. 
The case study focuses on Palmora Group, a manufacturing company based in Nigeria, currently facing employee gender inequality issues across its three regional branches. The analysis was based on two datasets:

•	Employee Data

•	Bonus Rules


## Objective
The goal of this analysis is to generate actionable insights that can help:

•	Assess average salary distribution across departments and regions.

•	Identify the presence and scope of a gender pay gap.

•	Recommend focus areas for management based on the insights derived


## Tools & Functions

•	Power BI
-  Data Modeling & Visualization
- DAX (Calculated Columns)


## Data Cleaning Process & Analysis
This was carried out based on the instruction given.

•	Removed blank entries in the department and salary columns.

•	Filled missing gender values with "unknown".

•	Removed duplicate rows.

•	Established a relationship between the employee and bonus datasets using model view.

•	Used power query to merge department fields and combine relevant columns.

•	Created a calculated column to group salary into salary range.

•	Created a custom column to calculate bonus Pay by multiplying the employee's salary by their department’s bonus rate and the total salary pay.


## Key Metrics & Insights
•	Average Salary: ₦73.75K

•	Minimum Salary: ₦28k

•	Total Number of Employees: 943

•	Total Number of Departments: 12

•	The company did not meet the manufacturing minimum wage of $90,000

•	202 employees earn over ₦100,000

•	Kaduna has the highest concentration of employees 

•	Male employees earn more on average than female employees across the company.

•	Salary band distribution is fairly spread across the three regions: Abuja, Kaduna, and Lagos but salary inequality is evident.


## Recommendations

1.	Conduct salary equity audits in departments with gaps.

2.	Review compensation bands and adjust for fairness by role and tenure.

3.	Enhance female representation in high-paying departments (Engineering, Sales).

4.	Improve promotion transparency and performance review processes.
